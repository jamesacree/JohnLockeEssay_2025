# What Is Your Fair Share of What Someone Else Has Earned?

### 🧠 Overview
This essay explores fairness through the lens of merit, access, and opportunity — arguing that a “fair share” of what someone else has earned is not their reward, but their **chance to compete** on an equal starting line. Drawing from thinkers like **John Rawls**, **Robert Nozick**, **Michael Sandel**, and **Immanuel Kant**, it examines the ethics of effort, inequality, and access through the real-world lens of youth sport and military leadership.

> “Fairness isn’t what you take; it’s the starting line you build.” — *James Acree*

### 📚 Abstract
In a meritocratic ideal, effort equals reward — yet modern systems often reward wealth over talent. Using the pay-to-play youth soccer model as a framework, the essay contrasts Rawls’ *difference principle* with Nozick’s entitlement theory, arguing that fairness lies not in redistribution of outcomes, but in **unrestricted access to opportunity**.  
The work connects these ideas to leadership ethics and military service, showing that fairness, whether on a field or in a unit, is about **equipping others to earn their place.**
